# Alzheimers-Detection
Final Project for CSE-572 Data Mining

Alzheimer's Disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder beyond cure which is hard to predict during its initial stages. Early diagnosis can really help in reducing the brain tissue damage by starting the treatment early when it is more effective compared to later stages. Detection of Alzheimerâ€™s is exacting because of the similarity in Alzheimer's Disease MRI scans and standard healthy MRI scans of older people due to which a lot of remarkable research is already done in this domain. Many machine learning models and statistical analysis methods have been used for this metabolic disease which affects a major part of the world population. Most studies done in this field use single data modality for making predictions, but fusion of multiple data modalities can provide a comprehensive view while analysis. Due to outstanding performance of Deep Learning techniques in the field of medical image analysis, I propose a hybrid multimodal deep convolutional neural network for early detection of Alzheimer's Disease using MRI data (images and text). The OASIS (Open Access Series of Imaging Studies) dataset has been used for this study and performance metrics have been computed to compare the multimodal network with unimodal approaches.
